## Lab Presentations

[Yuchen Lu](../../people/grad-students/yuchen-lu.qmd) presented a poster titled "A Hierarchical Bayesian Spatial Framework to Assess Nonstationary Rainfall Intensity, Frequency, and Duration in Texas" (NH13D-0410).
The work proposes a hierarchical Bayesian spatial model that efficiently pools information across space and jointly models precipitation across multiple time durations, enabling nonstationary IDF curve analysis across Texas.

[James Doss-Gollin](../../people/pi/james-doss-gollin.qmd) delivered a talk titled "TxRain: A Bayesian framework for integrating historical observations and model projections to develop nonstationary IDF curves" (H24A-07).
This work addresses the challenge of developing nonstationary extreme rainfall models by integrating accurate but short weather station records with long-term climate model projections.
James was also a coauthor on several other presentations at the conference.

## Session Convening

James served as chair for two sessions at AGU 2025:

- **NH31A: Advances in Urban Flood Risk Assessment and Adaptation I** (co-chaired with Vivek Srikrishnan)
- **NH43B: Interdisciplinary Advances in Catastrophe Modeling and Disaster Resilience: Bridging Science, Policy, and Practice II** (co-chaired with Benjamin Felzer)

Thanks to all our coauthors and session co-organizers for their collaboration, and we look forward to continuing these partnerships.
