[Yuchen Lu](../../people/grad-students/yuchen-lu.qmd) presented a poster on her research in probabilistic analysis of nonstationary hydroclimate extremes.
Her work demonstrates innovative approaches to understanding changing extreme weather patterns and their implications for infrastructure design and risk management.

[Dr. James Doss-Gollin](../../people/pi/james-doss-gollin.qmd) delivered a talk on modeling household adaptation to climate extremes using agent-based simulations for floods and droughts.
This research explores how communities and households respond to increasing climate risks.

## Session Convening

Dr. Doss-Gollin also served as chair for two sessions at AGU 2025, facilitating important discussions on natural hazards and climate risk assessment.
These sessions brought together researchers from around the world to share cutting-edge work on flood risk, disaster resilience, and multisector dynamics under climate change.
