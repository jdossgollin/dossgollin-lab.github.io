We are a mission-oriented research group addressing fundamental challenges in infrastructure resilience, risk assessment, and climate adaptation.
Our research vision is to characterize and manage climate risks to critical infrastructure systems and the communities who rely on them.

::: {.column width="55%"}
Achieving this vision requires integrated advances across climate science, engineering systems, risk analysis, and decision science.
Answering decision-relevant questions requires integrating better understanding and representation of weather and climate extremes with models of infrastructure systems and decision-making frameworks—all in computationally efficient ways that rigorously quantify uncertainty, are transparent and reproducible, and can inform real-world planning decisions.
Our research develops methods and tools in three interconnected areas:

## Research Themes

### Hydroclimate Hazard

![](bibliography/_assets/img/pubs/liu_generative_2025.png){.img-fluid}

Understanding future climate risks requires simulating high-impact weather and climate extremes with sufficient detail and accuracy.
We develop advanced statistical and machine learning methods—including hierarchical Bayesian models and generative diffusion—to characterize precipitation extremes, tropical cyclones, and other hazards that threaten communities.

**Example publications:** @liu_generative:2025, @lu_spatiotemporal:2025.

### Climate Risk Analysis

![](bibliography/_assets/img/pubs/doss-gollin_txtreme_2021.jpg){.img-fluid}

Climate hazards only become disasters when they interact with vulnerable infrastructure and populations.
We quantify the risks posed by climate extremes to critical infrastructure systems—including energy, water, and buildings—by combining physical models with probabilistic risk assessment frameworks.

**Example publications:** @rozer_lossestimates:2019, @doss-gollin_txtreme:2021.

### Climate Risk Management

![](bibliography/_assets/img/pubs/doss-gollin_subjective_2023.jpg){.img-fluid}

Infrastructure systems must serve communities reliably over decades despite deep uncertainties about future climate conditions.
We develop decision frameworks that identify robust and adaptive pathways for managing climate risks, enabling planners to make sound decisions even when the future is uncertain.

**Example publications:** @doss-gollin_subjective:2023, @zhou_mesoscale:2023.
