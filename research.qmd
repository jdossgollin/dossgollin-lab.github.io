The Doss-Gollin Lab is a mission-oriented research group addressing fundamental challenges in infrastructure resilience, risk assessment, and climate adaptation.
Our work is motivated by two interconnected questions:

1. **Hazard Simulation**: How can we better understand and simulate the weather and climate hazards that threaten our communities?
2. **Decision Support**: How can we use these simulations to identify robust decision pathways for designing adaptive, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure?

To answer these questions, we work at the intersection of Earth science (hydrology and atmospheric science), statistics and machine learning, and decision science (optimization and decision-making under deep uncertainty).

## Research Themes

### 1. Simulating Hydroclimatic Extremes

We develop and apply advanced statistical frameworks to characterize high-impact events like precipitation extremes, atmospheric rivers, and tropical cyclones.
By leveraging hierarchical Bayesian models and generative diffusion, we quantify climate risks and the deep uncertainties that surround them.

### 2. Physics-Informed ML for Flood Hazard Prediction

Scaling flood prediction across spatial and temporal scales requires methods that respect physical laws while leveraging large datasets.
We advance physics-informed machine learning and graph neural networks to simulate flood hazards and predict impacts on the built environment.

### 3. Robust Infrastructure Decision-Making

Infrastructure systems—including water, energy, and coastal defenses—are increasingly interdependent and exposed to evolving risks.
We develop frameworks to move beyond static risk assessments, instead identifying flexible decision pathways that remain robust under a wide range of future climate scenarios.
