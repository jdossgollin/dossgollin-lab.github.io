We are a mission-oriented research group addressing fundamental challenges in infrastructure resilience, risk assessment, and climate adaptation.
Our research vision is to characterize and manage climate risks to critical infrastructure systems and the communities who rely on them.

::: {.g-col-12 .g-col-md-7}
Achieving this vision requires integrated advances across climate science, engineering systems, risk analysis, and decision science.
Answering decision-relevant questions requires integrating better understanding and representation of weather and climate extremes with models of infrastructure systems and decision-making frameworks—all in computationally efficient ways that rigorously quantify uncertainty, are transparent and reproducible, and can inform real-world planning decisions.
Our research develops methods and tools in four interconnected areas:

## Probabilistic Hydroclimate Hazard

We develop advanced statistical and machine learning methods -- including hierarchical Bayesian models and generative diffusion -- to characterize extreme precipitation and other climate hazards.

## AI-Accelerated Flood Modeling

We advance physics-informed machine learning to rapidly and accurately predict flood extent and depth across spatial and temporal scales.

## Infrastructure and Systems Risk

We quantify the risks posed by climate extremes to critical infrastructure—including energy, water, and buildings—by combining physical models with probabilistic risk assessment frameworks.

## Adaptive Decision Making Under Uncertainty

We develop decision frameworks that identify robust and adaptive pathways for managing climate risks, enabling planners to make sound decisions despite deep uncertainties.
