These climate risks can be managed through the design and operation of infrastructure systems, as well as through disaster response and recovery. Decisions about how to develop and choose risk management strategies are often based on pure vibes, but occasionally rigorous quantitative analyses that make use of scientific information can inform them (we will focus on these cases). These analyses involve integrating knowledge from multiple disciplines to balance competing goals (objectives) under uncertainty.\nIn this course, you will learn a structured “bottom-up” decision analytic framework for quantitative climate risk analysis. This involves (i) defining a system of interest and what constitutes desirable outcomes; (ii) understanding and modeling the specific pathways through which climate variability and change can create risk to this system; (iii) identifying possible “levers” for risk management; (iv) quantifying the performance of proposed decisions under climate and other interacting factors; and (v) generating possible alternatives. You will be assigned readings for every class that cover both methods and applications, and will work collaboratively to implement key concepts through programming problem sets. Active class participation is required.\nMethods covered include scenario analysis, exploratory modeling, cost-benefit analysis, single- and multi-objective policy search, stochastic control, deep uncertainty, robust decision making, and equitable decision making."

    "section": "",
    "text": "It is widely acknowledged that distributed water systems (DWSs), which integrate distributed water supply and treatment with existing centralized infrastructure, can mitigate challenges to water security from extreme events, climate change, and aged infrastructure. However, it is unclear which are beneficial DWS configurations, i.e., where and at what scale to implement distributed water supply. We develop a mesoscale representation model that approximates DWSs with reduced backbone networks to enable efficient system emulation while preserving key physical realism. Moreover, system emulation allows us to build a multiobjective optimization model for computational policy search that addresses energy utilization and economic impacts. We demonstrate our models on a hypothetical DWS with distributed direct potable reuse (DPR) based on the City of Houston’s water and wastewater infrastructure. The backbone DWS with greater than link and node reductions achieves satisfactory approximation of global flows and water pressures, to enable configuration optimization analysis. Results from the optimization model reveal case-specific as well as general opportunities, constraints, and their interactions for DPR allocation. Implementing DPR can be beneficial in areas with high energy intensities of water distribution, considerable local water demands, and commensurate wastewater reuse capacities. The mesoscale modeling approach and the multiobjective optimization model developed in this study can serve as practical decision-support tools for stakeholders to search for alternative DWS options in urban settings."

    "title": "How Unprecedented Was the February 2021 Texas Cold Snap?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Winter storm Uri brought severe cold to the southern United States in February 2021, causing a cascading failure of interdependent systems in Texas where infrastructure was not adequately prepared for such cold. In particular, the failure of interconnected energy systems restricted electricity supply just as demand for heating spiked, leaving millions of Texans without heat or electricity, many for several days. This motivates the question: did historical storms suggest that such temperatures were known to occur, and if so with what frequency? We compute a temperature-based proxy for heating demand and use this metric to answer the question “what would the aggregate demand for heating have been had historic cold snaps occurred with today’s population?”. We find that local temperatures and the inferred demand for heating per capita across the region served by the Texas Interconnection were more severe during a storm in December 1989 than during February 2021, and that cold snaps in 1951 and 1983 were nearly as severe. Given anticipated population growth, future storms may lead to even greater infrastructure failures if adaptive investments are not made. Further, electricity system managers should prepare for trends in electrification of heating to drive peak annual loads on the Texas Interconnection during severe winter storms."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Purpose of Review Electricity systems face substantial climate risks which are escalating due to electrification, renewable energy intermittency, population changes, and the intensifying impacts of climate change such as extreme temperatures and weather-induced infrastructure damage. This critical review investigates climate risks to the electricity sector and scrutinizes the methodologies used to represent climate risk in long-term electricity system planning studies. Recent Findings Climate risks to electricity systems are driven by extreme weather, average weather, technology, and other social and technological factors. All are expected to evolve in the future. Future climate risks to electricity systems depend on interactions between each, and thus assessing future climate risks to electricity systems requires exploring a wide range of possible futures. Summary Many studies rely on weather data and socio-economic scenarios that are inadequate to fully characterize climate risks to present and future electricity systems. We advocate for more holistic assessments that incorporate comprehensive weather data, acknowledge dynamic multi-sector interactions, and employ adaptive and robust methodologies."

    "title": "Regional Extreme Precipitation Events: Robust Inference From Credibly Simulated GCM Variables",
    "section": "",
    "text": "General circulation models (GCMs) have been demonstrated to produce estimates of precipitation, including the frequency of extreme precipitation, with substantial bias and uncertainty relative to their representation of other fields. Thus, while theory predicts changes in the hydrologic cycle under anthropogenic warming, there is generally low confidence in future projections of extreme precipitation frequency for specific river basins. In this paper, we explore whether a GCM simulates large-scale atmospheric circulation indices that are associated with regional extreme precipitation (REP) days more accurately than it simulates REP days themselves, and thus whether conditional simulation of the precipitation events based on the circulation indices may improve the simulation of REP events. We show that a coupled Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory GCM simulates too many springtime REP days in the Ohio River Basin in historical (1950–2005) simulations. The GCM, however, does credibly simulate the distributional and persistence properties of several indices (which represent the large-scale atmospheric pressure features, local atmospheric moisture content, and local vertical velocity) that are shown to modulate the likelihood of REP occurrence in the reanalysis/observational record. We show that simulation of REP events based on the GCM-based atmospheric indices greatly reduces the bias of GCM REP frequency relative to the observed record. The simulation is conducted via a Bayesian regression model by imposing the empirical relationship between observed REP occurrence and the reanalysis-based atmospheric indices. Application of this model to future (2006–2100) representative concentration pathway 8.5 scenario suggests an increasing trend in springtime REP incidence in the study region. The proposed approach of simulating precipitation events of interest, particularly those poorly represented in GCMs, with a statistical model based on climate indices that are reasonably simulated by GCMs could be applied to subseasonal to seasonal forecasts as well as future projections."

    "title": "Robust Adaptation to Multiscale Climate Variability",
    "section": "",
    "text": "The assessment and implementation of structural or financial instruments for climate risk mitigation requires projections of future climate risk over the operational life of each proposed instrument. A point often neglected in the climate adaptation literature is that the physical sources of predictability differ between projects with long and short planning periods: while historical and paleo climate records emphasize modes of variability, anthropogenic climate change is expected to alter their occurrence at longer time scales. In this paper we present a set of stylized experiments to assess the uncertainties and biases involved in estimating future climate risk over a finite future period, given a limited observational record. These experiments consider both quasi-periodic and secular change for the underlying risk, as well as statistical models for estimating this risk from an N-year historical record. The uncertainty of IPCC-like future scenarios is considered through an equivalent sample size N. The relative importance of estimating the short- or long-term risk extremes depends on the investment life M. Shorter design lives are preferred for situations where inter-annual to decadal variability can be successfully identified and predicted, suggesting the importance of sequential investment strategies for adaptation."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Pluvial flood risk is mostly excluded in urban flood risk assessment. However, the risk of pluvial flooding is a growing challenge with a projected increase of extreme rainstorms compounding with an ongoing global urbanization. Considered as a flood type with minimal impacts when rainfall rates exceed the capacity of urban drainage systems, the aftermath of rainfall-triggered flooding during Hurricane Harvey and other events show the urgent need to assess the risk of pluvial flooding. Due to the local extent and small scale variations, the quantification of pluvial flood risk requires risk assessments on high spatial resolutions. While flood hazard and exposure information is becoming increasingly accurate, the estimation of losses is still a poorly understood component of pluvial flood risk quantification. We use a new probabilistic multi-variable modeling approach to estimate pluvial flood losses of individual buildings, explicitly accounting for the associated uncertainties. Except for the water depth as the common most important predictor, we identified the drivers for having loss or not and for the degree of loss to be different. Applying this approach to estimate and validate building structure losses during Hurricane Harvey using a property level data set, we find that the reliability and dispersion of predictive loss distributions vary widely depending on the model and aggregation level of property level loss estimates. Our results show that the use of multi-variable zero-inflated beta models reduce the 90% prediction intervals for Hurricane Harvey building structure loss estimates on average by 78% (totalling US$ 3.8 billion) compared to commonly used models."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The property damaged and the lives disrupted by recent hurricanes, floods, droughts, and water quality violations highlight the inadequacy of water infrastructure in the United States and around the world. Decisions about managing these infrastructure systems are strongly informed by societal perceptions of risk, which in turn are shaped through narratives of high-impact events in academic, governmental, commercial, and popular media. In recent years, post hoc analyses of high-impact water and climate disasters have increasingly focused on the role of anthropogenic climate change (ACC). This is a welcome development that helps to build support for much-needed mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions and pushes companies, governments, and aid agencies to prepare for a changing environment. Yet climate impacts require a confluence of physical hazards and societal vulnerabilities, and so narratives centered only on the role of ACC can neglect the aging infrastructure, increasing development with exposure to climate risks, and inadequate maintenance that set the stage for meteorological and hydrological events to become humanitarian disasters. The fatalistic narratives that emerge, which often imply that because an event was exacerbated by climate change its consequences could not have been averted, discourage adaptive planning."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Mississippi River Basin (MRB), the fourth-largest river basin in the world, is an important corridor for hydroelectric power generation, agricultural and industrial production, and riverine transportation. Historically, the Mississippi River has experienced floods resulting in significant loss of lives and property. In a future with an intensified global hydrological cycle, the altered discharge of the river may jeopardize communities and infrastructure situated in the floodplain. This study utilizes output from the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) large ensemble simulations spanning 1930 to 2100 to quantify changes in future MRB discharge under a high greenhouse gas emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0). These simulations show that increasing precipitation trends dominate increased evapotranspiration, driving an overall increase in total discharge in the Ohio and Lower Mississippi River basins. Decreasing spring snowmelt in both the Missouri and Ohio River basins results in the reduction of spring discharge. Our results harbor implications for water resources management including increased vulnerability of the Mississippi River given projected changes in climate."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Houston faces growing population and severe droughts, suggesting a need for robust water supply planning. Current literature proposes an exploratory modeling approach; however, Texas regions typically project water needs as point predictions based on historical droughts and an uncertainty factor. This thesis employs exploratory modeling to identify under which drought and demand conditions Houston’s water will be insufficient. The model includes a reservoir mass balance, Monte Carlo simulation to generate scenarios, and scenario discovery of shortages regardless of likelihood. Scenarios are compared to projections for context. Generally, scenarios with higher demand and 2011 drought demonstrated moderate supply shortage; scenarios with worse drought demonstrated extreme supply shortage. Houston’s proposed strategies mitigated higher demand, but had negligible mitigation for worse drought conditions. Given that climate change is expected to exacerbate droughts in Texas, this analysis underscores a need for water resource management in Houston to explore many possible futures."

A fim de alcançar os objetivos traçados alguns índices podem ser utilizados como índice de Palmer, o índice de severidade da seca de Palmer e o índice normalizado de precipitação. Para esse estudo o índice utilizado foi o índice de precipitação normalizada (SPI). Os resultados mostraram, temporalmente, que com o passar dos anos as secas têm ficado cada vez mais severas e cada vez mais estações meteorológicas têm sido incluídas em alguma categoria de seca. Isso mostra a necessidade da criação de um planejamento eficaz que possa ser desenvolvido ao longo de todo o ano e não apenas em época de secas extremas mais generalizadas."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Regional-scale extreme rainfall and flooding are temporally and spatially associated with the occurrence of tropical moisture exports (TMEs) in the Ohio River Basin (ORB). TMEs are related to but not synonymous with atmospheric rivers, which refer to specific filiamentary organizational processes. TMEs to the ORB may be driven by strong, persistent ridging over the Eastern United States and troughing over the Central United States, creating favorable conditions for southerly flow and moisture transport from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea. However, the strong inter-annual variation in TME activity over the ORB suggests dependence on global-scale features of the atmospheric circulation. We suggest that this synoptic dipole pattern may be viewed as the passage of one or more high-wavenumber, transient Rossby waves. We build a multi-level hierarchical Bayesian model in which the probability distribution of TME entering the ORB is a function of the phase and amplitude of the traveling waves. In turn, the joint distribution of the phase and amplitude of this wave is modulated by hemispheric-scale features of the atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and the amplitude and synchronization of quasi-stationary Rossby waves with wavenumber 1-4. Our approach bridges information about different features of the atmospheric circulation which inform the predictability of TME at multiple time scales and develops existing understanding of the atmospheric drivers of TMEs beyond existing composite and EOF studies."

    "section": "",
    "text": "A project led by Alicia Cooperman (TAMU), James Doss-Gollin (Rice), Alex Mayer (UTEP), and Shane Walker (UTEP) has been funded through the NSF EAGER SAI program. Here’s the description:\n\nIn this project, an iterative, collaborative framework for monitoring point of use water treatment in under­served communities is tested. This framework blends local expertise on social dynamics and water issues with project expertise in governance, water treatment, and systems modeling. This framework is co-developed with communities where residents rely on a combination of trucked­ and bottled water. Aging pipes and treatment facilities, droughts exacerbated, and contamination of water supplies all challenge America’s drinking water infrastructure. Water typically is treated at central facilities and then piped to users, but recent technological advances could enable water treatment at the point of use (e.g., a house). In theory, this approach can make water systems more resilient to extremes, reduce the need for pipes and pumping, help water systems scale up or down as populations change, and filter contaminants that existing plants cannot treat cost-effectively. However, point of use water treatment also shifts the burden of maintaining water treatment infrastructure, monitoring water quality, and governing water systems onto end users, creating new vulnerabilities for water infrastructure systems. In this project, an iterative, collaborative frame­work to stress test strategies for water quality monitoring in decentralized water treatment systems is developed to address this challenge. This research contributes to answering important questions for 21st century water infrastructure, including: (1) Under what biophysical and social conditions are decentralized water systems effective and likely to succeed? (2) What is the appropriate scale for decentralized water systems in small communities? (3) What are the barriers to water access in the US rural context?\n\n\nIn this project an iterative, collaborative frame­work to stress test strategies for water quality monitoring in decentralized water treatment systems is developed. The stress test integrates potential challenges identified by community members and leaders in focus groups with water quality sampling and mathematical modeling of water systems. The project is carried out through a series of iterative activities: qualitative interviews, field water quality observations, water system design, first round of focus groups, water security assessment, quantitative surveys and conjoint experiment, revised water system design, and a second round of focus groups. This project concerning participatory design for water quality monitoring extends observational research on water systems and social dynamics by actively engaging the community in collaborative focus groups about the current water system and potential future water systems.\n\nFor further details, see the NSF’s website."

    "text": "Aging infrastructure, increasing droughts, groundwater depletion, and contamination of water supplies challenge urban water security. While centralized approaches to water infrastructure have been instrumental in delivering reliable drinking water to many, many gaps and limitations remain.\nRecent research suggests a promising shift towards Modular, Adaptive, and Decentralized (MAD) water systems. These systems, which can range from point-of-use treatments in households to those serving clusters of households, offer the potential to reduce water transport costs, enhance resilience against natural hazards, tailor treatments to specific local contaminants, and adapt flexibly to future demographic and technological shifts. However, the success of MAD water systems is not just about technology; it’s deeply intertwined with socio-political factors, such as community trust and perceptions of water quality.\nTo address these multifaceted challenges, our research focuses on:"

A heterogeneidade climática do semiárido resulta em variados níveis de garantia de precipitação para enchimento das cisternas, levando em conta também outros fatores tais como a área de contribuição de telhados para captação da chuva, o coeficiente de escoamento superficial nos telhados e o descarte sanitário das primeiras chuvas. Este artigo apresenta um modelo de análise conjunta destes fatores para avaliar a sustentabilidade hídrica das cisternas no semiárido brasileiro. A análise revela que embora a captação de águas de chuva possa prover acesso sustentável a água potável em algumas áreas, não pode garantir acesso universal a água, particularmente para sistemas com áreas de captação pequenas ou para sistemas localizadas nas regiões mais secas."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Ensuring the reliable distribution of safe drinking water and proper disposal of wastewater is critical to the well-being of modern society. Water treatment plants (WTPs) and wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) tend to be located near large water bodies for cost-effective pumping of raw water and discharging of sewage downstream. Additionally, most WWTPs are built in low elevation areas to take advantage of gravity flows. Many WTPs and WWTPs are increasingly vulnerable to extreme precipitation events that occur more frequently due to global climate change. Hybrid systems that combine the centralized infrastructure and distributed wastewater treatment units with direct potable reuse (DPR) are an adaptation option for utilities. We investigate the benefit of such hybrid systems in terms of improving resilience to extreme precipitation events with a small city in the U.S., the City of Lumberton, North Carolina. Lumberton was hit by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018 with different extents of water and wastewater service failure. We build a quantitative model for the water system of Lumberton that enables many-query analysis. We examine the performance of a hybrid system, which has three distributed DPR sites at three existing tank stations that are located either outside 500-year flood hazard zones or in 500-year flood hazard zones with reduced risk, against two hazard scenarios relative to the original system. The first hazard scenario is the flooding of the WTP and the pump station, which reside in the 100-year flood hazard zone. The second is a biological invasion (Escherichia coli) from sewer overflow. We show that the hybrid system has a higher capacity to withstand flooding under certain levels. It can maintain reliable water supply for more than 72 hours if the DPR quantity is maximized, while the original system can only provide less than 24 hours of supply from tanks’ storage. Moreover, the hybrid system contains much-retained impacted areas in case of contaminant invasions as the distributed DPR sites form relatively independent pressure zones. We demonstrate that this modeling framework can provide decision-makers with quantitative data for what-if scenarios with new adaptation alternatives and their synergies (e.g., integrated water and wastewater systems, expanded power backup)."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The February 2021 Texas Freeze highlighted the vulnerability of energy systems and their co-dependent infrastructure systems on climatic factors. As Texas continues to be one of the leaders in the adoption of renewable wind and solar energy, the importance of understanding the joint dependence of the availability of these resources, and of the climate sensitive demand associated with heating and cooling becomes critical. We present a novel space-time simulator based on a generalized k-nearest neighbor method that can generate spatially distributed daily time step simulations of wind power, solar radiation and cooling (CDD) and heating (HDD) degree days. The simulations preserve the cross-field dependence in space and across times in our applications to a 40 year long historical climate re-analysis data from Texas, including the spatial structure of the principal components of the data and their associated temporal spectra. We use the simulations to identify annual maxima of HDD and CDD for different block lengths (e.g., 1, 3, 7, and 14 days) over the entire ERCOT and identify the corresponding available wind and solar resource also over ERCOT. These are then used to identify the joint probability distributions of climate sensitive energy supply and demand, and their associated uncertainty. The estimated multivariate return periods can be used to inform reliable system design. A diagnosis of the atmospheric circulation parameters that lead to the extremes was also conducted for physical insights as to the mechanisms."

    "text": "While most electricity systems are designed to handle peak demand during summer months, pathways to deep decarbonization generally electrify building heating, thus increasing electricity demand during winter. A key question is how climate variability and change will affect peak heating and cooling demand in an electrified future. We conduct a spatially explicit analysis of trends in temperature-based proxies of electricity demand over the past 70 years. Average annual demand for heating (cooling) decreases (increases) over most of the contiguous US. However, while climate change drives robust increases in peak cooling demand, trends in peak heating demand are generally smaller and less robust. Because the distribution of temperature exhibits a long left tail, severe cold snaps dominate the extremes of thermal demand. As building heating electrifies, system operators must account for these events to ensure reliability."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The Mississippi River is an important economic corridor used for generating hydroelectric power, transporting agricultural products, and providing water for municipalities and industries. The communities, industries, and infrastructure along the Mississippi River face an uncertain future as it becomes more vulnerable to climate extremes. One of the main challenges in predicting future hydroclimate conditions in the Mississippi River basin is determining whether river discharge will increase or decrease during the 21st century. Due to the limited time coverage of the 20th century record, paleoclimate data and model simulations are used to gain a better understanding of how the basin’s hydroclimate responds to external influences. In this study, we investigate how human activities during the 20th century have affected the statistics of river discharge compared to a baseline representing the last millennium. We use simulations from the Community Earth System Model Last Millennium Ensemble (CESM-LME) to assess changes in key hydroclimate variables over various time scales, ranging from monthly to centennial. By conducting simulations with both anthropogenic and natural single-forcing, we can identify the hydrological responses to each type of climate forcing separately. We also conduct full-forcing simulations to evaluate projected changes in the 21st century. The results indicate that greenhouse gas emissions and land use changes generally led to wetter conditions in the 20th century compared to the pre-industrial era. However, the 21st century is projected to have more extreme precipitation events, while the overall basin is expected to be drier compared to the 20th century. The Last Millennium simulations provide additional climate information, which improves the predictive power by expanding the pool of statistics available. Understanding the factors that contributed to past flooding events can help in developing strategies to mitigate future regional floods."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Government agencies often require environmental risk mitigation strategies to pass a cost-benefit test. All else equal, these favor protection of valuable assets, which can produce inequitable outcomes. We demonstrate that distributional equity in efficient risk mitigation is influenced by how efficiency is operationalized and propose an alternative efficiency measure which better satisfies egalitarian and prioritarian equity notions. We compare optimal allocations of $100 million to home elevation projects in New Orleans, that minimize flood risk measured in (i) dollars or (ii) as a proportion of a structure’s replacement cost. Minimizing the latter metric allocates more resources to impoverished neighborhoods. It reduces proportional damage to residences by an additional 11% at the expense of 2% of economic damages. Composite strategies show even more favorable tradeoffs (4% proportional damage for 0.04% economic damage). This demonstrates the power of equity-aware efficiency measures in improving distributional outcomes."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Classical approaches for flood prediction apply numerical methods for the solution of partial differential equations that capture the physics of inundation processes (e.g. the 2D Shallow Water equations). However, traditional inundation models are still unable to satisfy the requirements of many relevant applications, including early-warning systems, high-resolution (or large spatial domain) simulations, and robust inference over distributions of inputs (e.g. rainfall events). Machine learning (ML) approaches are a promising alternative to physics-based models due to their ability to efficiently capture correlations between relevant inputs and outputs in a data-driven fashion. In particular, once trained, ML models can be tested/deployed much more efficiently than classical approaches. Yet, few ML-based solutions for spatio-temporal flood prediction have been developed and their reliability/accuracy is poorly understood. In this paper, we propose FloodGNN-GRU, a spatio-temporal flood prediction model that combines a graph neural network (GNN) and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) architecture. Compared to existing approaches, FloodGNN-GRU (i) employs a graph-based model (GNN); (ii) operates on both spatial and temporal dimensions; and (iii) processes the water flow velocities as vector features, instead of scalar features. We evaluate FloodGNN-GRU using a LISFLOOD-FP simulation of Hurricane Harvey (2017) in Houston, Texas. Our results, based on several metrics, show that FloodGNN-GRU outperforms several data-driven alternatives in terms of accuracy. Moreover, our approach can be trained 100x faster and tested 1000x faster than the time required to run a comparable simulation. These findings illustrate the potential of ML-based methods to efficiently emulate physics-based inundation models, especially for short-term predictions."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Projections of nonstationary climate risks can vary considerably from one source to another, posing considerable communication and decision-analytical challenges. One such challenge is how to present trade-offs under deep uncertainty in a salient and interpretable manner. Some common approaches include analyzing a small subset of projections or treating all considered projections as equally likely. These approaches can underestimate risks, hide deep uncertainties, and are mostly silent on which assumptions drive decision-relevant outcomes. Here we introduce and demonstrate a transparent Bayesian framework for synthesizing deep uncertainties to inform climate risk management. The first step of this workflow is to generate an ensemble of simulations representing possible futures and analyze them through standard exploratory modeling techniques. Next, a small set of probability distributions representing subjective beliefs about the likelihood of possible futures is used to weight the scenarios. Finally, these weights are used to compute and characterize trade-offs, conduct robustness checks, and reveal implicit assumptions. We demonstrate the framework through a didactic case study analyzing how high to elevate a house to manage coastal flood risks."

    "section": "",
    "text": "During the austral summer 2015/16, severe flooding displaced over 170 000 people on the Paraguay River system in Paraguay, Argentina, and southern Brazil. These floods were driven by repeated heavy rainfall events in the lower Paraguay River basin. Alternating sequences of enhanced moisture inflow from the South American low-level jet and local convergence associated with baroclinic systems were conducive to mesoscale convective activity and enhanced precipitation. These circulation patterns were favored by cross-time-scale interactions of a very strong El Niño event, an unusually persistent Madden–Julian oscillation in phases 4 and 5, and the presence of a dipole SST anomaly in the central southern Atlantic Ocean. The simultaneous use of seasonal and subseasonal heavy rainfall predictions could have provided decision-makers with useful information about the start of these flooding events from two to four weeks in advance. Probabilistic seasonal forecasts available at the beginning of November successfully indicated heightened probability of heavy rainfall (90th percentile) over southern Paraguay and Brazil for December–February. Raw subseasonal forecasts of heavy rainfall exhibited limited skill at lead times beyond the first two predicted weeks, but a model output statistics approach involving principal component regression substantially improved the spatial distribution of skill for week 3 relative to other methods tested, including extended logistic regressions. A continuous monitoring of climate drivers impacting rainfall in the region, and the use of statistically corrected heavy precipitation seasonal and subseasonal forecasts, may help improve flood preparedness in this and other regions."

    "text": "The potential for extreme climate events to cluster in space and time has driven increased interest in understanding and predicting compound climate risks. Through a case study on floods in the Ohio River Basin, we demonstrated that low-frequency climate variability could drive spatial and temporal clustering of the risk of regional climate extremes. Long records of annual maximum streamflow from 24 USGS gauges were used to explore the regional spatiotemporal patterns of flooding and their associated large-scale climate modes. We found that the dominant time scales of flood risk in this basin were in the interannual (6–7 years), decadal (11–13 years), and secular bands and that different sub-regions within the Ohio River Basin responded differently to large-scale forcing. We showed that the leading modes of streamflow variability were associated with ENSO and secular trends. The low-frequency climate modes translated into epochs of increased and decreased flood risk with multiple extreme floods or the absence of extreme floods, thus informing the nature of compound climate-induced flood risk. A notable finding is that the secular trend was associated with an east-to-west shift in the flood incidence and the associated storm track. This is consistent with some expectations of climate change projections."

    "title": "MAD Water: Integrating Modular, Adaptive, and Decentralized Approaches for Water Security in the Climate Change Era",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Centralized water infrastructure has, over the last century, brought safe and reliable drinking water to much of the world. But climate change, combined with aging and underfunded infrastructure, is increasingly testing the limits of—and reversing gains made by—this approach. To address these growing strains and gaps, we must assess and advance alternatives to centralized water provision and sanitation. The water literature is rife with examples of systems that are neither centralized nor networked, yet meet water needs of local communities in important ways, including: informal and hybrid water systems, decentralized water provision, community-based water management, small drinking water systems, point-of-use treatment, small-scale water vendors, and packaged water. Our work builds on these literatures by proposing a convergence approach that can integrate and explore the benefits and challenges of modular, adaptive, and decentralized (“MAD”) water provision and sanitation, often foregrounding important advances in engineering technology. We further provide frameworks to evaluate justice, economic feasibility, governance, human health, and environmental sustainability as key parameters of MAD water system performance."

    "title": "Leveraging Mesh Modularization to Lower the Computational Cost of Localized Updates to Regional 2D Hydrodynamic Model Outputs",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Hydrodynamic model outputs are used in urban flood risk modelling, flood alert systems, and Monte Carlo hazard assessment. This study tackles an under-explored challenge wherein regular updates to the spatial characteristics of the watershed – due to factors such as changing land use – alter the watershed’s response to rainfall forcing, thus rendering existing model outputs obsolete. Because state-of-the-art hydrodynamic models are computationally expensive, frequently re-running simulations can be costly. Modularization addresses this problem by requiring re-computation only for a limited domain affected by the land use changes. This article introduces a novel approach by modularizing the 2D domain into independent sub-domains before (‘discrete’) and after (‘abstract’) the numerical computations. Using the Hydrologic Engineering Center River Analysis System (HEC-RAS) 2D model of a large urban watershed in Houston as an illustrative and generalizable testbed, we show that both the discrete and abstract modularization closely approximates the results from re-running the entire model. The computational cost of modularization scales linearly with model size for memory requirements as storing the solution on the interior boundaries (discrete) or throughout the domain (abstract) are necessary. This trade-off of memory for computation may facilitate advances in surrogate modelling or Monte Carlo flood risk assessment."

    "title": "Analytic Modeling of Rainwater Harvesting in the Brazilian Semiarid Northeast",
    "section": "",
    "text": "During the past two decades, government efforts to provide water access to rural communities in Brazil’s semiarid Northeast region have focused on building systems to capture and store rainwater, most importantly through the One Million Cisterns Program (P1MC). This article presents an analytic model based on daily precipitation data to evaluate the sustainability of rainwater capture. Application of this model to analysis of the P1MC reveals the heterogeneous climate in this region causes large spatial variability in the effectiveness of this program. In addition, the size of the area of capture, the run-off coefficient of the roofs, and the amount of first-flush diversion also have important effects. This analysis demonstrates while rainwater capture can offer sufficient water for drinking, as a stand-alone solution it cannot meet P1MC objectives of guaranteeing sustainable and universal access to water for drinking, cooking, and basic hygiene in all regions and years."

Making sense of these data sets, sometimes vast and sometimes consisting of a few observations, requires integrating domain knowledge, computational methods, and statistical models. In a nutshell, data science.\nThe path from data and theory to models, inference, and ultimately decisions is long, winding, and perilous. In this course, you will learn not only how to fit models, but also how to interpret, critique, improve, and evaluate models and model-based inference. Specifically, you will learn a principled workflow for using data to inform decisions that:\n\ncredibly describes the physical processes that generated the data;\nflexibly makes use of multiple sources of information;\ntransparently communicates imperfect modeling assumptions; and\nallows you to reason about uncertainty using the language of probability theory.\n\nApplications to water, climate, air, and geologic data will emphasize models for spatial and temporal data."
