## Course Description

CEVE 421/521 addresses critical questions at the intersection of climate science, engineering, and decision-making.
The course tackles challenges like flood protection investment in cities, which are characterized by many potential adaptations, deep uncertainty, complex system dynamics, and temporal structure.

The course is structured in three parts:

1. **Risk Analysis** – Uses probabilistic methods to characterize climate hazards and quantify uncertainty
2. **Decision Analysis** – Evaluates options through cost-benefit analysis, sensitivity analysis, and value of information
3. **Optimization Under Uncertainty** – Develops robust strategies via exploratory modeling, sequential decision-making, and multi-objective optimization

The course emphasizes discussion of current research and foundational methods alongside hands-on computational labs.
Students develop risk management strategies for a hypothetical coastal city scenario while learning Julia, Quarto, and GitHub for reproducible analysis and collaboration.
