I welcome postdoctoral researchers interested in the quantitative study of climate hazard, risk, and resilience.
Our research bridges climate science, hydrology, statistics, and decision science to address challenges in climate hazard, risk, and resilience.

## Current Opportunities

Current funded positions are listed on the [Open Positions](/joinus/open-positions.qmd) page.

If you have your own funding (e.g., NSF postdoctoral fellowship, fellowship from your home country) or are interested in developing a joint proposal, please reach out even if no position is posted.

## How to Apply

Email me directly with:

1. Your CV
2. A brief statement (1-2 paragraphs) describing:
   - Your research interests and career goals
   - How your work aligns with the group's research
   - Proposed start date and duration
3. Names of 2-3 references

**Note**: Generic emails that don't demonstrate familiarity with the group's work won't receive a response.

If there's strong alignment, we'll schedule a conversation to discuss potential collaboration.

## Funding Opportunities

If you're interested in applying for external funding to support a postdoc in the group, here are some opportunities we can discuss:

- [NSF Earth Sciences Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503144)
- [NSF Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504843)
- [Smith Fellowship](https://conbio.org/mini-sites/smith-fellows) (conservation science)
- Various international fellowships (e.g., Marie Curie, JSPS, Newton International)

I'm happy to work with you to develop competitive proposals for these or other opportunities.

## What to Expect

Postdocs in the group have the opportunity to:

- Develop independent research agendas aligned with their career goals
- Mentor graduate and undergraduate students
- Collaborate with partners across academia, government, and industry
- Present work at conferences and workshops
- Build professional networks in climate risk and water resources

All postdocs are expected to be productive researchers and good collaborators who contribute to a supportive lab environment.
