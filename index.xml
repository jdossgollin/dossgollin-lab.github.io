  <title>Published: theorizing modular, adaptive, and decentralized water systems</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2023/2023-07-12-mad-water.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>A paper resulting from an exciting interdisciplinary workshop on “MAD” (Modular, Adaptive, and Decentralized) water systems is now published.</p>
<p>Centralized water systems are a truly awesome accomplishment, but they face financial, climatic, and governance stressors and aren’t going to meet the needs of every person in every community. Modular, Adaptive, and Decentralized approaches to water harvesting, treatment, distribution, monitoring, and governance can help! At the same time, there are key risks and limitations. In general, MAD water is not intrinsically good or bad, but it’s an emerging phenomenon and opportunity that water folks should pay attention to.</p>
<p>I had a ton of fun collaborating with new colleagues, especially those with social science expertise. This is a pretty accessible read, with lots of examples and jargon restricted to what the whole team was able to follow. For more, see <a href="../../publications/article/wutich_madwater_2023.html">the abstract</a>.</p>

  <title>New paper on mesoscale modeling of distributed water systems</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2023/2023-04-23-mesoscale.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>A paper led by Rice PhD student Xiangnan Zhou is now out in <em>Water Resources Research</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="zhou_mesoscale:2022">(Zhou et al., 2023)</span>.</p>
<p>We know that decentralized water systems can be improve resilient to natural disasters and population growth, though they often require substantial energy. Previous work has shown the importance of carefully considering the spatial layout of these systems, but the computational cost of doing so has limited the size of the systems that can be considered. Here, we present a backbone algorithm for creating physically based water networks that are computationally efficient enough to be used in large-scale optimization problems, yet topologically close to the full network.</p>

  <title>NSF Award from EAGER SAI: ‘Participatory Design for Water Quality Monitoring of Highly Decentralized Water Infrastructure Systems’</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2021/2021-08-27-nsf-eager-sai.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>A project led by Alicia Cooperman (TAMU), James Doss-Gollin (Rice), Alex Mayer (UTEP), and Shane Walker (UTEP) has been funded through the NSF EAGER SAI program. Here’s the description:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In this project, an iterative, collaborative framework for monitoring point of use water treatment in under­served communities is tested. This framework blends local expertise on social dynamics and water issues with project expertise in governance, water treatment, and systems modeling. This framework is co-developed with communities where residents rely on a combination of trucked­ and bottled water. Aging pipes and treatment facilities, droughts exacerbated, and contamination of water supplies all challenge America’s drinking water infrastructure. Water typically is treated at central facilities and then piped to users, but recent technological advances could enable water treatment at the point of use (e.g., a house). In theory, this approach can make water systems more resilient to extremes, reduce the need for pipes and pumping, help water systems scale up or down as populations change, and filter contaminants that existing plants cannot treat cost-effectively. However, point of use water treatment also shifts the burden of maintaining water treatment infrastructure, monitoring water quality, and governing water systems onto end users, creating new vulnerabilities for water infrastructure systems. In this project, an iterative, collaborative frame­work to stress test strategies for water quality monitoring in decentralized water treatment systems is developed to address this challenge. This research contributes to answering important questions for 21st century water infrastructure, including: (1) Under what biophysical and social conditions are decentralized water systems effective and likely to succeed? (2) What is the appropriate scale for decentralized water systems in small communities? (3) What are the barriers to water access in the US rural context?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In this project an iterative, collaborative frame­work to stress test strategies for water quality monitoring in decentralized water treatment systems is developed. The stress test integrates potential challenges identified by community members and leaders in focus groups with water quality sampling and mathematical modeling of water systems. The project is carried out through a series of iterative activities: qualitative interviews, field water quality observations, water system design, first round of focus groups, water security assessment, quantitative surveys and conjoint experiment, revised water system design, and a second round of focus groups. This project concerning participatory design for water quality monitoring extends observational research on water systems and social dynamics by actively engaging the community in collaborative focus groups about the current water system and potential future water systems.</p>

  <title>Call for Abstracts: Statistical-Dynamical Models for Hydroclimatic Risk Management and Adaptation</title>
  <link>https://dossgollin-lab.github.io/posts/2021/2021-06-24-agu21.html</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 



<p>The <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/prelim.cgi/Session/118811">session</a> is listed in Hydrology, Natural Hazards, Global Environmental Change, and Atmospheric Sciences. Here’s the description:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Decision-making for climate adaptation relies on projections of hydroclimate variables at a range of interconnected spatial and temporal scales. Many simulation and optimization frameworks rely on such projections as an input to system models, and so analysts must balance a desire for large ensembles to explore risk and grounding in physical principles for credible out-of-sample simulation against computational cost and interpretability. We welcome submissions related to the development and validation of statistical-dynamical models of hydroclimate variables, as well as their applications to infrastructure design, operation, and hazard assessment. Submissions related to weather and streamflow generators, emulators of sea level and storm surge, weather downscaling methods, and optimal sampling of design events are particularly encouraged.</p>
</blockquote>
