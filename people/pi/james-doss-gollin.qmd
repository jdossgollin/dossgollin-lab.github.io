## Bio

James Doss-Gollin is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Rice University.
His research vision is to scale systems analysis and decision support for the complex, interdependent infrastructure systems facing evolving climate risks.
To achieve this, he advances and applies methods from statistics and machine learning to quantify climate risks, characterize relevant uncertainties, and identify robust decision pathways under uncertainty.

Before joining Rice, James was a postdoctoral researcher in the Earth and Environmental Systems Institute at Pennsylvania State University.
He earned his PhD and MS in Earth and Environmental Engineering from Columbia University and holds a BS in Mechanical Engineering from Yale University.
